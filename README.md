# Welcome to the Blue Box Program Data Analysis 🌱♻️
Join me as we embark on an eco-conscious journey into the heart of data analysis, where sustainability meets insight. 

In Canada, the renowned Blue Box Program takes center stage in the realm of waste management and recycling. It's a nationwide effort, orchestrated by diverse municipalities and organizations, with a shared vision of promoting recycling and responsible material disposal in our homes and communities. The program equips residents with blue boxes or bins designed to cradle recyclables like paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and metal. These materials are tenderly plucked from the regular trash stream and sent on a path of renewal through recycling.

Operated by a nationwide waste management organization, this program spans over 70 locations, reaching 9 provinces. With a whopping 5.4 million active participants, its commitment to boosting recycling knows no bounds. Year after year, it welcomes a 5% rise in fresh contributors, contributing to the successful recycling of an impressive 740,000 tons of waste materials on average.

At the heart of this project, you'll find a deep-seated passion for the environment and an unwavering dedication to effective waste management.

## Project Goals 🎯

My mission? To craft an all-encompassing framework for data analysis, guiding us through data cleaning, preparation, feature analysis, and regression. It's a roadmap to unearth the hidden gems buried within the data, one step at a time.

Together, let's dive in and unlock the potential of this data-driven exploration! 🚀📊
